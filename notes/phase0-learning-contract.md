# Phase 0 — Learning Contract  
**Project:** Computer Science — Beginner to Expert (Surya’s Path)  
**Author:** Surya Goutham Abraham Kanikairaj  
**Date:** Nov 1st 2025

## 🎯 Purpose

To build a reproducible, disciplined, and lifelong foundation in Computer Science — from first principles to mastery.  
This contract defines the rhythm, tools, and mindset for the journey. It transforms learning from a hobby into a structured engineering project.

## 🧭 Guiding Philosophy

1. **Start from first principles:** Never memorize — understand *why* every concept exists.  
2. **Abstraction ladder:** Always move from the physical → logical → mathematical → computational.  
3. **Historical depth:** Know *who* created each idea and *what problem* they were solving.  
4. **Cross-disciplinary synthesis:** Link Computer Science with math, physics, and philosophy.  
5. **Build while learning:** Every module produces a working code or circuit.  
6. **Reflection > Quantity:** Measure learning by clarity, not hours.

## 📚 Habits & Metrics

- **Tools:** Anki (spaced repetition), Obsidian/Notion (Zettelkasten notes), GitHub for versioning  
- **Metrics:**
  - 5 notes/week committed  
  - 1 lab exercise/week completed  
  - Weekly reflection added to `/checkpoints/`  
  - Monthly summary README update
